      <p>Today I sat by the lake with my notebook. The water was calm, the mountains gentle, and the breeze carried a whisper from a dream I might’ve once lived. I wrote about a girl who never stopped believing in the warmth of handwritten letters and lingering sunsets.</p>

      <p>Hallstatt feels quieter this week, or maybe I’m just more in tune with the silence. Every step through the cobblestones echoes thoughts for my next chapter. There’s magic in solitude — a sort of peace that tucks itself into my stories.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-2">April 20th, 2025</h2>
      <p>I'm heading to another state to write another story. People always ask me, 'Why do all the characters in your books have happy endings?' Well, I can't just say, 'Because I want their lives to be different from mine,' can I? </p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-2">April 10th, 2025</h2>
      <p>The spring breeze carries whispers of past journeys. I watch the flowers bloom outside my window, each petal a fragile promise of stories yet to be told. Sometimes I wonder if these tales find their way into the hearts of others or simply echo within my own. </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-2">March 5th, 2025</h2>
      <p>The rain tapped gently on the café window while I scribbled the last lines of a chapter. Strange how the sound of falling drops can stir so many memories — of laughter, tears, and moments frozen between pages. Maybe endings are just beginnings waiting patiently. </p>

    <div class="diary-entry">
      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-2">February  14th, 2025</h2>
      <p>Valentine’s Day alone, but the quiet is warm. I pour my thoughts onto paper, letting characters dance in the candlelight of my mind. They all deserve happiness — a sanctuary I sometimes struggle to find for myself. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-2">January 1st, 2025</h2>
      <p>A new year, a blank page. The world feels heavy with possibility and the weight of unwritten words. I resolve to chase the stories that hide beneath unfamiliar skies, to find magic in the mundane, and to believe in the beauty of every small moment. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-2">December 20th, 2024</h2>
      <p>Winter’s hush falls over the village, snow muffling the sounds of the world. I wrap myself in thick scarves and warm memories, penning scenes of hope and gentle resilience. My characters teach me that even the coldest nights hold a promise of dawn. </p>
